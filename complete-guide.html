              The model is straightforward: there's one daily meeting called
              “Collab Hour,” approximately one hour in duration, where all
              necessary discussions take place. This process promotes a healthy
              skepticism toward additional meetings, forbidding them unless
              there's a clear justification.

              During each session, six descending priorities guide the
              discussion, though it's not necessary for all six to be completed
              before concluding the meeting. If you find that later priorities
              never get addressed, it may be beneficial to pick up each day
              where you left off the previous day, but remember to avoid getting
              stuck in the middle of the list for several days in a row.

              Customers should regularly should join the “Collab Hour” session
              to provide feedback and answer questions. This works fairly well
              at two weeks, which is a similar cadence to most sprints in Scrum.
              It should be noted, however, that this does not require a release
              at the same interval. Wherever possible, favor continuous
              deployment with feature flags to minimize long-lived feature
              branches.

              While no particular metrics are required by this framework, teams
              may choose to track data for continuous improvement. Excessive
              process overhead is generally discouraged, but there is only one
              absolute prescription regarding metrics &mdash; any data generated
              by the team must remain strictly confidential. If such data is
              consumed by external parties, it may lead to misconceptions which
              could wrongly influence how the team is handled or perceived. The
              team's reputation should be judged by the quality of its output
              alone.

                Always favor “working sessions” over “meetings.” When
                determining whether scheduled time is necessary, it's important
                to answer “yes” to one of these two questions:

                With that in mind, collaborative sessions are encouraged, such
                as pair or mob programming. With empathy, take into
                consideration your coworkers' social tolerance levels before
                scheduling additional time. For some, Collab Hour alone may be
                pushing the limit. The important part is optimizing team
                synergy, for the most enjoyable and productive collaboration
                experience.

                  best to avoid this practice. Instead, use this time to
                  determine whether a story is as small as it can possibly get

                <p class="article-section__text">
                  Careful bug reporting is essential for smooth transitions from
                  QA to development. Poorly written bug reports can lead to
                  unnecessary confusion and delay their resolution. Below is a
                  checklist of items that should be included in every bug
                  report.
                </p>
                <ol class="article-section__list">
                  <li class="article-section__list-item">
                    <strong>Environments:</strong> This is not only the
                    environment the bug was reported in, but rather
                    <em>all</em> environments where the bug exists. (Common
                    environments might include: DEV, TEST, QA, and STAGING.)
                    This helps a developer understand when and how the bug was
                    introduced.
                  </li>
                  <li class="article-section__list-item">
                    <strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong> Provide a comprehensive
                    list of all user actions from the moment the app is opened
                    until the bug is observed.
                  </li>
                  <li class="article-section__list-item">
                    <strong>Scenario:</strong> It's the responsibility of the
                    bug reporter to outline the details of the scenario and
                    reproduce the issue in the development environment. All the
                    necessary prerequisite data must be in place for the
                    developer to begin working. If reproduction is not possible,
                    this should be noted during triage before the task is picked
                    up.

                  <li class="article-section__list-item">
                    <strong>Expected vs Actual:</strong> Clearly articulate the
                    expected behavior versus what is observed. This reduces
                    uncertainty and provides guidelines for acceptance to close
                    the bug.
                  </li>

                <p class="article-section__text">
                  To triage bugs effectively, determine the severity in terms of
                  "low," "medium," or "high." If a bug is deemed "low," it may
                  be deferred to a later date. A "medium" bug should be resolved
                  reasonably quickly, but it is not necessary to pause
                  everything else. If a bug has a "high" severity, all other
                  work should be paused until it is resolved.
                </p>
                <p class="article-section__text">
                  It's important to note that the severity of a bug is not
                  necessarily related to its complexity. A "high" severity bug
                  may be a simple fix, while a "low" severity bug may be
                  difficult to resolve. The severity is determined by the impact
                  the bug has on the user experience.
                </p>
                <p class="article-section__text">
                  If a bug is found with a story that is currently in progress
                  and unreleased to production, avoid creating a separate bug
                  report. Instead, add the bug to the story as a subtask, as
                  additional tracking will only create confusion. Bugs found in
                  active stories do not need to be assigned a severity, as no
                  users will be impacted until the story is released.

                multiple individuals or create subtasks for convenience.

                If any team member is blocked, whether by something outside
                their control or simply by a difficult task that requires
                assistance, then the team should work together during the Collab
                Hour session to resolve the issue promptly.

                If the organization and team are structured properly, then no
                blocker should lie beyond the team's power to rectify
                internally. Addressing blockers in real-time eliminates the need
                for deferred action items and facilitates a swift return to
                productivity.

                While collaboration is encouraged for most tasks, there are
                occasions where individual work is more suitable. If any such
                code is sitting in review, Collab Hour presents an occasion to
                make any corrections as a group, then merge once it has
                unanimous approval. The goal is to adjust and merge code during
                the group review, rather than leaving comments for the pull
                request owner to address at a later time.

                is a tactic for group collaboration on a single computer. With
                remote work becoming more commonplace, this can be accomplished
                by using tools such as VSCode's Live Share extension, or
                IntelliJ's Code With Me. You can try different approaches and
                adapt it to what works best for the team, but essentially, mob
                programming is the idea of rotating these roles at set
                intervals:
              </p>
              <ol class="article__list">
                <li class="article__list-item">
                  <strong>Driver:</strong> The typist, responsible for
                  implementing instructions provided by the navigator. This role
                  offers valuable learning opportunities.
                </li>
                <li class="article__list-item">
                  <strong>Navigator:</strong> Coordinates input from team
                  members and guides the driver. This role is ideal for leading
                  the team.
                </li>
                <li class="article__list-item">
                  <strong>Advisors:</strong> Everyone else in the room is tasked
                  with open communication, answering questions, and making
                  suggestions. This role is best for offering a specific set of
                  knowledge or expertise.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="article__text">
                Roles can be rotated at regular intervals, such as every ten
                minutes, to ensure equal contribution from all team members.
                While these roles provide structure, teams should feel free to
                adjust them as needed. A mature team may even spontaneously
                switch roles based on emerging ideas or needs.

                A key part of Agile is continuous improvement, often achieved
                through retrospective sessions. Traditionally, teams use methods
                like sticky notes or digital equivalents to categorize ideas
                into columns such as "start, stop, continue." However, this
                approach requires the interruption of ongoing tasks to meet and
                discuss.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                An alternative approach is to continuously reflect throughout
                the day. The retro board should remain accessible at any time so
                ideas can be recorded as they arise. During the Collab Hour
                session, the team can work together to agree on process changes
                to address each suggestion. The intent is to take each item as
                far as possible before beginning a group conversation around it.
                This approach is a more efficient use of time and primes the
                discussion to be more fruitful.
