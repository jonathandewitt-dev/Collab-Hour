          The model is straightforward: there's one daily meeting called “Collab
          Hour,” approximately one hour in duration, where all necessary
          discussions take place. This process promotes a healthy skepticism
          toward additional meetings, forbidding them unless there's a clear
          justification.
        </p>
        <p class="section__text">
          During each session, six descending priorities guide the discussion,
          though it's not necessary for all six to be completed before
          concluding the meeting:
        </p>
        <ol class="section__list">
          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Refine:</strong> Refine new stories, triage bugs, and
            prioritize tech debt.
          </li>
          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Assign:</strong> Ensure each team member has assigned work.

          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Unblock:</strong> Identify blockers and resolve them during
            this session. There's no sense noting action items if the team is
            capable of assisting immediately.
          </li>
          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Review:</strong> Review all outstanding pull requests.
          </li>
          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Mob:</strong> Identify the top priority and use mob
            programming to get it done. This involves the entire team including
            Product and QA; immediate feedback is invaluable.
          </li>
          <li class="section__list-item">
            <strong>Retrospect:</strong> If there's nothing urgent, review
            retrospective items. Each day, the team should add items to a board
            asynchronously, so that they can eventually be reviewed together in
            this meeting.

          Customers should regularly should join the “Collab Hour” session to
          provide feedback and answer questions. This works fairly well at two
          weeks, which is a similar cadence to most sprints in Scrum. It should
          be noted, however, that this does not require a release at the same
          interval. Wherever possible, favor continuous deployment with feature
          flags to minimize long-lived feature branches.

        <p class="section__text">
          While no particular metrics are required by this framework, teams may
          choose to track data for continuous improvement. While additional
          process overhead is generally discouraged, there is only one absolute
          prescription in this regard - any metrics generated by the team must
          remain strictly confidential. If such data is consumed by external
          parties, it will surely leave misleading impressions of the team's
          effectiveness.

            Always favor “working sessions” over “meetings.” When determining
            whether scheduled time is necessary, it's important to answer “yes”
            to one of these two questions:
          </p>
          <ol class="article__list">
            <li class="article__list-item">
              Will this session accomplish a tangible outcome?

          </ol>
          <p class="article__text">
            Additionally, we should also answer “yes” to this one follow-up
            question.
          </p>
          <ol class="article__list">
            <li class="article__list-item">

          <p class="article__text">
            With that in mind, collaborative sessions are encouraged, such as
            pair or mob programming. With empathy, take into consideration your
            coworkers' social tolerance levels before scheduling additional
            time. For some, Collab Hour alone may be pushing the limit. The
            important part is optimizing team synergy, for the most enjoyable
            and productive collaboration experience.

            Refinement is the process of preparing tasks for development. The
            goal is to have a clear understanding of the work required before
            development begins.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            While it is important to prepare tasks for development, it is
            equally important to avoid spending the entire hour refining tasks.
            Focus on refining only the most important tasks for the day, and
            make sure to leave time for other priorities.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Some days, you may find that there are no tasks to refine. This is

              Most, if not all authors of the original Agile manifesto agree

              best to avoid this practice. Instead, use this time to determine
              whether a story is as small as it can possibly get while also
              delivering a complete feature, or “vertical slice” if you prefer.
              Be sure all requirements are provided and no uncertainties remain.

              Careful bug reporting is essential for smooth transitions from QA
              to development. Poorly written bug reports can lead to unnecessary
              confusion and delay their resolution. Below is a checklist of
              items that should be included in every bug report.
            </p>
            <ol class="article-section__list">
              <li class="article-section__list-item">
                <strong>Environments:</strong> This is not only the environment
                the bug was reported in, but rather <em>all</em> environments
                where the bug exists. (Common environments might include: DEV,
                TEST, QA, and STAGING.) This helps a developer understand when
                and how the bug was introduced.
              </li>
              <li class="article-section__list-item">
                <strong>Steps to reproduce:</strong> Provide a comprehensive
                list of all user actions from the moment the app is opened until
                the bug is observed.
              </li>
              <li class="article-section__list-item">
                <strong>Scenario:</strong> It's the responsibility of the bug
                reporter to outline the details of the scenario and reproduce
                the issue in the development environment. All the necessary
                prerequisite data must be in place for the developer to begin
                working. If reproduction is not possible, this should be noted
                during triage before the task is picked up.
              </li>
              <li class="article-section__list-item">
                <strong>Expected vs Actual:</strong> Clearly articulate the
                expected behavior versus what is observed. This reduces
                uncertainty and provides guidelines for acceptance to close the
                bug.

              Technical debt tasks should be authored and tracked by engineers,

              quality.

            <p class="article-section__text">
              Putting aside refinement for a moment, it's vital to consider a
              key aspect of this topic. Regular attention must be given to
              completing technical debt each week, rather than focusing solely
              on new features. It's best to allocate dedicated time each week
              for both product and development sides to work independently. This
              should provide engineers with the necessary time to address
              technical debt.

            components, such as frontend, backend, and database changes. In such

            works best for the team, but essentially, mob programming is the
            idea of rotating these roles at set intervals:

            A key part of Agile is continuous improvement, often achieved
            through retrospective sessions. Traditionally, teams use methods
            like sticky notes or digital equivalents to categorize ideas into
            columns such as "start, stop, continue." However, this approach
            requires the interruption of ongoing tasks and dedicated time during
            everyone's workday.

            An alternative approach is to continuously reflect throughout the
            day. Team members may jot down ideas as they arise and discuss them
            spontaneously. An accessible retro board should be maintained, where
            ideas can be recorded at any time. When the team convenes during the
            Collab Hour session, the team can work together to agree on process
            changes to address each suggestion. The intent is to take each item
            as far as possible before beginning a group conversation around it.
