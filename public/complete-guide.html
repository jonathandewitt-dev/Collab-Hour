                    The "Review" stage has been removed entirely, because pull
                    requests are not necessarily a consideration at all in
                    modern teams, and as such are not worth baking into the
                    process. With the heavy emphasis on collaboration, peer
                    reviews should happen naturally without a formal step.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    "Unblock" is now at the top, because knocking down walls is
                    always the most valuable thing you can do for a team.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    "Retrospect" now comes before "Mob," because mob sessions
                    tend to take all the remaining time, and retrospection is
                    too valuable to skip.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    "Refine" is now last, because if a team has no tasks to work
                    on, then refinement becomes the fallback activity anyway.
                    All other steps are more valuable than planning, relatively
                    speaking.

                  <li>
                    Instead of low/medium/high, bugs are now classified as
                    blocking, non-blocking, or partially-blocking. This language
                    is less likely to be misinterpreted, and eliminates the need
                    for follow-up explanations.

              The model is straightforward: there's one daily working session
              called “Collab Hour,” for approximately one hour, where the entire
              process unfolds. This process
              <em>forbids</em> additional meetings without a clear
              justification. See the section on “<a
                class="link"
                href="#meetings"
                >when meetings are acceptable</a
              >” for more details.

              Regarding metrics, there is only one absolute &mdash; any
              performance data must remain strictly confidential to the team. If
              such data is consumed by external parties, (upper managers,
              executives, stakeholders), it may wrongly influence how the team
              is handled or perceived. The team's reputation should be judged by
              the quality of its output alone. Therefore, only those metrics
              that focus on value delivery should be made available externally.

                Seems Prescriptive... Is It Really Agile?
              </h3>
              <p class="article__text">
                It's a fair question. Agility is about adaptability and
                collaboration, not process rigidity. This framework is designed
                to be just structured enough to protect and preserve the core
                values of the Agile Manifesto.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                Teams are still encouraged to evolve the process continuously
                based on retrospective feedback. What matters is that the
                changes come from within the team itself, not imposed from
                above. The team owns the process, and that ownership is what
                keeps it agile.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                Iteration is essential, but only after the process has been
                lived long enough to reveal its strengths and weaknesses, not as
                a reflex to old habits. It may take a few weeks to adjust, but
                the value of each guideline will quickly become apparent.

                Always favor “working sessions” over “meetings.” When
                determining whether scheduled time is necessary, it's required
                to answer “yes” to at least one of these two questions:
              </p>
              <ol class="article__list">

              </ol>
              <p class="article__text">
                Additionally, we should also answer “yes” to this one follow-up
                question.

              <p class="article__text">
                If the answer to either of the first questions is “no,” then the
                meeting should not be planned. If the answer to the follow-up
                question is “no,” then all participants who are not required
                should be excused. These guidelines should be observed with
                strict discipline to avoid unnecessary interruptions.

                If a meeting is necessary and it involves the entire team, the
                following day's Collab Hour session should be considered before
                scheduling a standalone meeting. If the topic can be addressed
                during the Collab Hour session, then it should be. If the topic
                is too urgent to wait, or it only concerns a couple members of
                the team, then additional time may be scheduled, but it should
                be kept as focused as possible.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                All meetings should have a clear agenda. If the agenda does not
                align with the questions above, then the invited participants
                will be expected to decline the meeting. The facilitator should
                be held accountable for scheduling only necessary meetings.
                Productive work should always be the priority.

              <p class="article__text">
                With that in mind, collaborative sessions are encouraged, such
                as pair or mob programming. With empathy, take into
                consideration your coworkers' social tolerance levels before
                allocating extra time. For some, Collab Hour alone may be
                pushing the limit. The important part is optimizing team
                synergy, for the most enjoyable and productive collaboration
                experience.

                A key part of Agile is continuous improvement, often achieved
                through retrospective sessions. Traditionally, teams use methods
                like sticky notes or digital equivalents to categorize ideas
                into columns such as "start, stop, continue." However, this
                approach requires the interruption of ongoing tasks to meet and
                discuss.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                An alternative approach is to continuously reflect throughout
                the day. The retro board should remain accessible at any time so
                ideas can be recorded as they arise. During the Collab Hour
                session, the team can work together to agree on process changes
                to address each suggestion. The intent is to take each item as
                far as possible before beginning a group conversation around it.
                This approach is a more efficient use of time and primes the
                discussion to be more fruitful.

                programming is the idea of rotating the following roles at

                  pay down tech debt, or else risk issues with stability and

                Feedback is a critical component of any successful team. It is
                important to regularly solicit feedback from customers to ensure
                that the team is building the right product, constantly adapting
                to change rather than focusing too much on scope and
                requirements up front.

                Customers should be invited to join the Collab Hour session to
                create an open dialogue, so that the team can better understand
                the needs and expectations of the end users. The frequency of
                customer feedback sessions should be determined by the team, but
                the standard is every two weeks.

                These feedback sessions do not require a release at the same
                interval. It's often best to release features as soon as they
                are ready, rather than waiting for a predetermined release date.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                While not specifically required, a continuous deployment
                strategy works well with this model. Feature flags allow the
                team to release features to production without making them
                visible to end users. This minimizes the risk of long-lived
                feature branches and allows the team to gather feedback early
                and often.

              <p class="article__text">
                Teams are not required to track metrics, but they may opt to do
                so. All performance metrics must be kept strictly confidential,
                for the team's eyes only, apart from HR, upper management,
                executives, stakeholders, and so on.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                Metrics focused on "value delivered," such as those listed in
                the
                <a class="link" href="https://dorametrics.org/">DORA Metrics</a
                >, may prove more valuable to external parties than velocity,
                for example.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                Performance tracking places unnecessary stress on the team,
                which can lead to a decrease in morale and thus increase
                turnover. Furthermore, surveillance of such metrics often drives
                the wrong behavior, such as inflating numbers and rearranging
                tasks to make the burndown chart look better, rather than
                focusing on code quality, customer value, or business revenue.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                While performance metrics may seem easy to measure, ignoring
                nuance in the circumstances may lead to incorrect conclusions.
                For example, a senior engineer may go several weeks without
                delivering a single story, but they may be providing invaluable
                mentorship to the team. The value of this mentorship is not
                reflected in the metrics, so when evaluating performance, it may
                unfairly appear that the engineer is not contributing.

                The full and accurate truth is not easily quantifiable. This is
                a fact of life. To make the best decisions, we must accept this
                uncomfortable reality and remain cognizant of the limitations of
                our data. Instead of predictablitiy, we should optimize for
                <em>effectiveness</em>, which inherently involves a degree of
                uncertainty. The alternative is to optimize for metrics, which
                is a dangerous path that often leads to poor outcomes. Read more
