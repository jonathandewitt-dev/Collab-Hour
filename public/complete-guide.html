                  The "Review" stage has been removed entirely, because pull
                  requests are not necessarily a consideration at all in modern
                  teams, and as such are not worth baking into the process. With
                  the heavy emphasis on collaboration, peer reviews should
                  happen naturally without a formal step.
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Unblock" is now at the top, because knocking down walls is
                  always the most valuable thing you can do for a team.
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Retrospect" now comes before "Mob," because mob sessions tend
                  to take all the remaining time, and retrospection is too
                  valuable to skip.
                </li>
                <li>
                  "Refine" is now last, because if a team has no tasks to work
                  on, then refinement becomes the fallback activity anyway. All
                  other steps are more valuable than planning, relatively
                  speaking.

                  Instead of low/medium/high, bugs are now classified as
                  blocking, non-blocking, or partially-blocking. This language
                  is less likely to be misinterpreted, and eliminates the need

              The model is straightforward: there's one daily meeting called
              “Collab Hour,” approximately one hour in duration, where all
              necessary discussions take place. This process
              <em>forbids</em> additional meetings without a clear
              justification. See the section on “<a

              During each session, five descending priorities guide the
              discussion, though it's not necessary for all five to be completed
              before concluding the meeting. If you find that later priorities
              never get addressed, it may be beneficial to pick up each day
              where you left off the previous day, but remember to avoid getting
              stuck in the middle of the list for several days in a row.

              Customers should regularly join the “Collab Hour” session to
              provide input and answers in real time. This may work fairly well
              at two weeks, which is a familiar cadence for many teams today,
              but the team should agree on whatever makes the most sense for
              them. It should be noted, however, that this does not require a
              release at the same interval. Favor continuous delivery; release
              at least once every day.

              While no particular metrics are required by this framework, teams
              may choose to track data for continuous improvement. Excessive
              process overhead is generally discouraged, but there is only one
              absolute prescription regarding metrics &mdash; any performance
              data generated by the team must remain strictly confidential. If
              such data is consumed by external parties, (upper managers,
              executives, stakeholders), it may lead to misconceptions which
              could wrongly influence how the team is handled or perceived. The
              team's reputation should be judged by the quality of its output
              alone. Therefore, only those metrics that focus on value delivery
              should be made available externally. Read more in the section on

                Always favor “working sessions” over “meetings.” When
                determining whether scheduled time is necessary, it's required
                to answer “yes” to at least one of these two questions:
              </p>

                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="article__text">
                Additionally, we should also answer “yes” to this one follow-up
                question.

              <p class="article__text">
                If the answer to either of the first questions is “no,” then the
                meeting should not be planned. If the answer to the follow-up
                question is “no,” then all participants who are not required
                should be excused. These guidelines should be observed with
                strict discipline to avoid unnecessary interruptions.
              </p>

                If a meeting is necessary and it involves the entire team, the
                following day's Collab Hour session should be considered before
                scheduling a standalone meeting. If the topic can be addressed
                during the Collab Hour session, then it should be. If the topic
                is too urgent to wait, or it only concerns a couple members of
                the team, then additional time may be scheduled, but it should
                be kept as focused as possible.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                All meetings should have a clear agenda. If the agenda does not
                align with the questions above, then the invited participants
                will be expected to decline the meeting. The facilitator should
                be held accountable for scheduling only necessary meetings.
                Productive work should always be the priority.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                With that in mind, collaborative sessions are encouraged, such
                as pair or mob programming. With empathy, take into
                consideration your coworkers' social tolerance levels before
                allocating extra time. For some, Collab Hour alone may be
                pushing the limit. The important part is optimizing team
                synergy, for the most enjoyable and productive collaboration
                experience.

                A key part of Agile is continuous improvement, often achieved
                through retrospective sessions. Traditionally, teams use methods
                like sticky notes or digital equivalents to categorize ideas
                into columns such as "start, stop, continue." However, this
                approach requires the interruption of ongoing tasks to meet and
                discuss.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                An alternative approach is to continuously reflect throughout
                the day. The retro board should remain accessible at any time so
                ideas can be recorded as they arise. During the Collab Hour
                session, the team can work together to agree on process changes
                to address each suggestion. The intent is to take each item as
                far as possible before beginning a group conversation around it.
                This approach is a more efficient use of time and primes the
                discussion to be more fruitful.

                is a tactic for group collaboration on a single computer. With
                remote work becoming more commonplace, this can be accomplished
                by using tools such as VSCode's Live Share extension, or
                IntelliJ's Code With Me. You can try different approaches and
                adapt it to what works best for the team, but essentially, mob
                programming is the idea of rotating the following roles at
                regular intervals, such as every ten minutes.

                the current thought and then commit the code before ending the

                customer feedback sessions should be determined by the team, but

                the wrong behavior, such as inflating numbers and rearranging
                tasks to make the burndown chart look better, rather than

                While performance metrics may seem easy to measure, ignoring
                nuance in the circumstances may lead to incorrect conclusions.
                For example, a senior engineer may go several weeks without
                delivering a single story, but they may be providing invaluable
                mentorship to the team. The value of this mentorship is not
                reflected in the metrics, but the resulting increase in team
                productivity is undeniable.

                The full and accurate truth is not easily quantifiable. This is
                a fact of life. To make the best decisions, we must accept this
                uncomfortable reality and remain cognizant of the limitations of
                our data. Instead of predictablitiy, we should optimize for
                effectiveness, which inherently involves a degree of
                uncertainty. The alternative is to optimize for metrics, which
                is a dangerous path that often leads to poor outcomes.
