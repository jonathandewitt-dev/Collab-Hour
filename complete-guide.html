              The model is straightforward: there's one daily meeting called
              “Collab Hour,” approximately one hour in duration, where all
              necessary discussions take place. This process
              <em>forbids</em> additional meetings without a clear
              justification. See the section on “<a
                class="link"

              During each session, six descending priorities guide the
              discussion, though it's not necessary for all six to be completed
              before concluding the meeting. If you find that later priorities
              never get addressed, it may be beneficial to pick up each day
              where you left off the previous day, but remember to avoid getting
              stuck in the middle of the list for several days in a row.

              Customers should regularly should join the “Collab Hour” session
              to provide feedback and answer questions. This works fairly well
              at two weeks, which is a similar cadence to most sprints in Scrum.
              It should be noted, however, that this does not require a release
              at the same interval. Wherever possible, favor continuous
              deployment with feature flags to minimize long-lived feature
              branches.

              While no particular metrics are required by this framework, teams
              may choose to track data for continuous improvement. Excessive
              process overhead is generally discouraged, but there is only one
              absolute prescription regarding metrics &mdash; any data generated
              by the team must remain strictly confidential. If such data is
              consumed by external parties, it may lead to misconceptions which
              could wrongly influence how the team is handled or perceived. The
              team's reputation should be judged by the quality of its output
              alone. Read more in the section on “<a

                Always favor “working sessions” over “meetings.” When
                determining whether scheduled time is necessary, it's required
                to answer “yes” to at least one of these two questions:
              </p>
              <ol class="article__list">
                <li class="article__list-item">

                <li class="article__list-item">
                  Will avoiding this discussion impose a blocker to progress?
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="article__text">
                Additionally, we should also answer “yes” to this one follow-up
                question.
              </p>
              <ol class="article__list">
                <li class="article__list-item">
                  Is this equally true for every single person in attendance?

              <p class="article__text">
                If the answer to either of the first questions is “no,” then the
                meeting should not be planned. If the answer to the follow-up
                question is “no,” then all participants who are not required
                should be excused. These guidelines should be observed with
                strict discipline to avoid unnecessary interruptions.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                If a meeting is necessary and it involves the entire team, the
                following day's Collab Hour session should be considered before
                scheduling a standalone meeting. If the topic can be addressed
                during the Collab Hour session, then it should be. If the topic
                is too urgent to wait, or it only concerns a couple members of
                the team, then additional time may be scheduled, but it should
                be kept as focused as possible.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                All meetings should have a clear agenda. If the agenda does not
                align with the questions above, then the invited participants
                will be expected to reject the meeting. The facilitator should
                be held accountable for scheduling only necessary meetings.
                Productive work should always be the priority.
              </p>
              <p class="article__text">
                With that in mind, collaborative sessions are encouraged, such
                as pair or mob programming. With empathy, take into
                consideration your coworkers' social tolerance levels before
                allocating extra time. For some, Collab Hour alone may be
                pushing the limit. The important part is optimizing team
                synergy, for the most enjoyable and productive collaboration
                experience.

                Refinement is the process of preparing tasks for development.
                The goal is to have a clear understanding of the work required

                While it is important to prepare tasks for development, it is
                equally important to avoid spending the entire hour refining
                tasks. Focus on refining only the most important tasks for the
                day, and make sure to leave time for other priorities.

                Some days, you may find that there are no tasks to refine. This
                is perfectly normal, and in fact better for the sake of
                productivity. Simply move on to the next priority.

                  Stories are the most common type of task in software. They are
                  typically written in the form of a user story, which describes
                  a feature from the perspective of the user: "As a...I
                  want...so that..." This helps orient the team around the
                  user's needs, rather than the technical implementation.

                  Most, if not all authors of the original Agile manifesto agree
                  that stories should not be estimated in points nor time, so
                  it's best to avoid this practice. Instead, use this time to
                  determine whether a story is as small as it can possibly get
                  while also delivering a complete feature, or “vertical slice.”

                  Careful bug reporting ensures smooth transitions from QA to
                  development. Poorly written bug reports can lead to
                  unnecessary confusion and delay their resolution. Below is a
                  checklist of items that should be included in every bug
                  report.

                    environment the bug was reported in, but rather
                    <em>all</em> environments where the bug exists. (Common
                    environments might include: DEV, TEST, QA, and STAGING.)
                    This helps a developer understand when and how the bug was
                    introduced.

                    list of all user actions from the moment the app is opened
                    until the bug is observed.

                    <strong>Scenario:</strong> It's the responsibility of the
                    bug reporter to outline the details of the scenario and
                    reproduce the issue in the development environment. All the
                    necessary prerequisite data must be in place for the
                    developer to begin working. If reproduction is not possible,

                <p class="article-section__text">
                  Technical debt, or just "tech debt," is the cost of additional
                  work created by choosing an easy solution now instead of a
                  better solution that would take longer. Tech debt is not
                  inherently bad, but it should be managed effectively to avoid
                  accumulating to the point where it impedes progress. It's
                  normal as a natural result of practicing KISS (keep it simple
                  stupid) or YAGNI (you aren't gonna need it) principles, which
                  is often a good thing. We shouldn't introduce complexity too
                  early, but we should adapt as the system grows.

                <p class="article-section__text">
                  Introducing tech debt deliberately is a choice for engineers
                  alone to make, not product owners. Engineers possess the
                  technical expertise to make informed decisions around
                  acceptable risk and quality. In a similar vein, engineers
                  should also author and track tech debt tasks, as they are best
                  equipped to understand the work involved and its implications.

                <p class="article-section__text">
                  To allow the necessary time to address tech debt, engineers
                  must be given sufficient time each week to work independently
                  of product demands. This time should be protected and not used
                  for additional feature work.

                Some tasks, particularly complex stories, may require the

                database. In such cases, multiple individuals may be assigned to
                the same story, or subtasks could be created to track each layer
                independently. This often requires a high degree of

                remote work becoming more commonplace, this can be accomplished
                by using tools such as VSCode's Live Share extension, or
                IntelliJ's Code With Me. You can try different approaches and
                adapt it to what works best for the team, but essentially, mob
                programming is the idea of rotating the following roles at
                regular intervals, such as every ten minutes.

                A key part of Agile is continuous improvement, often achieved
                through retrospective sessions. Traditionally, teams use methods
                like sticky notes or digital equivalents to categorize ideas
                into columns such as "start, stop, continue." However, this
                approach requires the interruption of ongoing tasks to meet and
                discuss.

                An alternative approach is to continuously reflect throughout
                the day. The retro board should remain accessible at any time so
                ideas can be recorded as they arise. During the Collab Hour
                session, the team can work together to agree on process changes
                to address each suggestion. The intent is to take each item as
                far as possible before beginning a group conversation around it.
                This approach is a more efficient use of time and primes the
                discussion to be more fruitful.

                nuance in the circumstances may lead to incorrect conclusions.
                For example, a senior engineer may go several weeks without
                delivering a single story, but they may be providing invaluable
                mentorship to the team. The value of this mentorship is not
                reflected in the metrics, but the resulting increase in team
